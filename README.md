# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.

### Features
This app allows us to sort our github repos according to their popularity. Includes additional functionality to
collapse panels to reveal additional content of our repo. When you input your token, you can then load up anyones public repository by inputting their username.
